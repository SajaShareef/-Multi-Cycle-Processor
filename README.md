# -Multi-Cycle-Processor


This project aims at the creation and application of a Multi-Cycle Processor following a specified instruction set. We meticulously designed the processor by examining each instruction and identifying its essential components. The subsequent steps involved constructing these components and devising methods to control them effectively. To ensure the smooth functioning of the processor, we undertook thorough testing of each component individually, established connections between them, tested each instruction in isolation, and validated instructions that are interdependent.

 Project Overview
- Objective: Design and implement a Multi-Cycle Processor based on a specific instruction set.

Implementation Details

- Component Construction: Careful attention was given to constructing essential components such as registers, ALU, control unit, and memory units.
  
- Integration: Components were seamlessly integrated to form the complete processor architecture, facilitating efficient data flow and instruction execution.
  
- Testing Strategy: A systematic testing strategy was employed, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing to validate the processor's functionality and performance.
